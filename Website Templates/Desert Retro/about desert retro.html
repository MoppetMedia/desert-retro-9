        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Rae Canyon — a freelance designer, illustrator, traveller, and visual storyteller with a deep love for nostalgia and desert aesthetics. </p>

        <p>Growing up in the American Southwest, I developed a love for the raw beauty of nature at an early age. I spent my childhood and teens wandering desert trails with my Mom (also an avid hiker), soaking in and painting the colors of the world around me. These experiences would later shape my perosonal style: desert nostalgia.</p>
        
<p>At the University of Arizona, I majored in Graphic Design where I became drawn to old advertising posters and illustration styles from the early 20th century. I also spent a year abroad in Merzouga, Morocco, immersing myself in the country's desert scene.</p>

<p>Since graduating, I worked with local businesses developing logos, branding materials, marketing campaigns, illustrations, and photography. With each new project, I remain committed to telling stories that reflect my love for the desert and its people, blending nostalgia with modern design.</p>

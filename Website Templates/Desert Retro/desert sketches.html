    <h3>Morning Nomad</h3>
    <p>A classically-inspired illustration, with cross-hatching to create depth and texture. Fine, controlled strokes for a realistic yet slightly romanticized approach, as often seen in 19th-century travel sketches or engravings. Graphite pencils, a combination of softer and harder grades. The darker, more defined lines made through the use of 2B or 4B. The lighter, more delicate lines made with H and 2H. Smooth blending achieved through use of a blending stump and my finger.</p>

    <h3>Roxana</h3> 
    <p>Hyper-realistic focus on the eyes and the draped fabric of the headscarf. Techniques include delicate cross-hatching and blending to create the soft folds of the fabric and the intense gaze of the eyes. Graphite pencils used across various grades. For the eyes: 2B and 4B. For the fabric and background: H or 2H. Blending achieved with stump and tissue.</p>

    <img src="./Images/Touareg Guide.png" alt="Drawing of a desert nomad with turban with face veiled.">
    <h3>Touareg Guide</h3>
    <p>Realistic style with a focus on detailed texture and depth, leaning toward a classical portrait approach often seen in historical or cultural illustrations. The pencil work is done with graphite. Softer pencils, 2B and 4B, are used for the darker, more defined areas like the deep shadows in the folds of the fabric and the falcon's feathers. Lighter areas, like the highlights on the robe are created with the use of harder pencils H and 2H. I also use cross-hatching and blending—with my finger—to achieve smooth tonal transitions, particularly in the fabric.</p>

    <img src="./Images/Caravan in the Desert.png" alt="Drawing of a caravan in the desert.">
    <h3>Caravan in the Desert</h3>  
    <p>A minimalist, illustrative style, evoking a desert caravan with clean, fluid lines. The pencil work uses a medium-grade graphite, HB and 2B, with light, sketchy strokes for dunes and darker marks for shadows, focusing on line work over blending.</p>

    <img src="./Images/Self Portrait.png" alt="Drawing of a young woman wearing a sun hat.">
    <h3>Self Portrait</h3>
    <p>Self-portrait. The style is a detailed, realistic portrait with a modern, elegant flair, focusing on facial features and hat texture. Pencil work uses graphite, 2B and 4B for dark shading on the hat and hair, with HB for lighter facial details, featuring cross-hatching and blending for depth.</p>

    <h3>My Inspiration: Laura Gilpin</h3>

    <p>Laura is my hero! On her twelfth birthday, Laura received a Kodak Brownie Camera which changed her life. I got my first camera when I was a year older. Her example reminds me to see not just the grandeur but the quiet lives within it. That's the kind of desert work I try to do. Laura's ethics guide me: always honor the people of the land first.</p>

    <h3>My Inspiration: Richard Misrach</h3>
    <p>When I first got a copy of Richard Misrach's Desert Cantos, I was hooked! My series Heat Notes is my own version of a canto. Its an ongoing study of heatwaves across desert regions—from Sonora to Syria. Every image is taken at over 110°F. Like Misrach, I want viewers to feel the cost of climate, even when it's visually arresting.</p>

    <img src="./Images/Lonely Shrub.png" alt="A solitary shrub standing in the middle of a vast, sunlit desert.">
    <h3>Survivor</h3>
    <p>This image speaks to the quiet persistence of life in the harshest places. The lone shrub, dwarfed by endless sand and sky, reminds me how even the smallest forms can thrive against all odds. I wanted to capture the sense of isolation and subtle hope that defines the desert’s spirit.</p>

    <img src="./Images/Bent by the Desert.png" alt="A woman in a desert bending to her feet.">
    <h3>Bent</h3>
    <p>This photograph captures a moment of quiet reflection and resilience. The figure, bent toward the earth, echoes the shapes carved by wind and time. I wanted to show how the desert shapes not just the land, but those who move through it—bending, but never breaking.</p>

    <img src="./Images/Camel Photo.png" alt="Side view of front quarters of a camel in a desert.">
    <h3>Wanderer</h3>
    <p>Photographing this camel, I was struck by the way it seemed to merge with the landscape. Through this image, I wanted to evoke the timeless journey of desert wanderers—steady, enduring, and always moving forward.</p>

    <img src="./Images/Southwest Americana Black and White.png" alt="Black and white photo of an American Southwest desert scene with a wooden shed and two horses grazing.">
    <h3>Southwest Americana</h3>
    <p>This photograph captures the nostalgia and spirit of road trips I took during college through the American Southwest. As Richard Misrach says, “You look at landscape, but it's not really landscape, it's a symbol for our country, it's a metaphor for our country.”</p>
